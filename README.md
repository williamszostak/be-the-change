# be-the-change
Score for the song **Be the Change**, written and arranged for the [Leftist Marching Band](https://www.leftistmarchingband.org/home/)

This score was created using [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en). To edit or play the score in MuseScore, first install the latest version of the [MuseScore application](https://musescore.org/en/download), then open the files:

 - **Be the Change/[Be the Change.mscx](./Be%20the%20Change/Be%20the%20Change.mscx)**.
 - **Be the Change - bass/[Be the Change - bass.mscx](./Be%20the%20Change%20-%20bass/Be%20the%20Change%20-%20bass.mscx)**.

Bass parts are separated out because they have two-part endings on the repeats (*prima volta* and *secunda volta*). I didn't want all the other parts to have an unnecessary duplication with identical ending measures.
